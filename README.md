## Digital FM Voice in a 10HP Eurorack Module

_DX7-inspired FM synthesis with a Raspberry Pi Pico_

<img src="Dexy.jpg" style="float:right">

This is not a Yamaha DX7 clone, but it uses similar operators and algorithms
to create a single FM voice. It has pitch and timbre modulation, onboard patch
storage, and a USB connection that talks to custom patch editing software.

This module requires a 16-pin Eurorack power cable that supplies +5 V power in addition to +12 V and -12 V.

Part of my [homebrew Eurorack synthesizer](https://len42.github.io/Synth/).

### Features

- Single FM voice loosely based on the Yamaha DX7's 6-operator voice architecture
- Inputs: Gate, pitch (1V/oct), pitch mod, timbre mod
- Attenutators on the modulation inputs
- Gate and 1V/oct inputs can default to the Eurorack bus gate line (jumper-selectable) - more info [here](https://len42.github.io/Synth/eurorack-bus-cv-gate.html)
- Timbre control knob
- Rotary encoder and OLED display for patch selection and note animations
- RP2040-based microcontroller module (similar to [Raspberry Pi Pico](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/microcontrollers/raspberry-pi-pico.html))
- USB connection to download patches and firmware
- Computer software for patch editing, with live updating to the module over USB
